## GAIA Agent Forge - Next.js site

Production-ready marketing site for Green AI & Automation (GAIA), built with Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, and shadcn UI.

### Tech
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn UI, Radix
- **Analytics**: Plausible (client event helpers wired)
- **Testing/QA**: Playwright smoke + a11y, Lighthouse CI

### Quick start
```bash
nvm use 20 # or use your Node 20 runtime
npm i
npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000
```

### Build and preview
```bash
npm run build     # next build && next export -o out
npm start         # serves ./out on port 3000
```

### Test and lint
```bash
npm test          # Playwright smoke + a11y
npm run lint      # ESLint
```

### Project structure
- `app/` - App Router pages (`/`, `/services`, `/why-gaia`, `/projects`, `/learning-hub`, `/about`, `/contact`)
- `components/` - UI primitives (Button, Card), layout (Header, Footer)
- `lib/` - utilities (`cn`, Plausible event helper)
- `tests/` - Playwright tests and config

Notes:
- Root Next.js app is the canonical app. `apps/web-next/` is legacy/sandbox and not part of build/deploy.

### Deployment - Netlify (recommended)
This site uses static export and works great on Netlify.

Netlify config: see `netlify.toml`.

Pipeline:
- Connect the GitHub repo in Netlify.
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `out`
- Branch: `main`

Custom domain `greenaiautomation.ai`:
- In Netlify, add the domain and verify.
- Either delegate DNS to Netlify (simplest) or add DNS records at your registrar:
  - `CNAME` for `www` â†’ your-site-name.netlify.app
  - `ALIAS`/`ANAME` (or A records provided by Netlify) for apex `@`
- Enable HTTPS (Netlify auto-provisions certificates).

### Deployment - GitHub Pages (optional)
The repo also includes a Pages workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) that deploys `out/` from `main`.
If you use Netlify, you can ignore or remove it.

### Environment and analytics
- Plausible script is loaded site-wide. To customize domain or add props, edit `app/layout.tsx` and `lib/analytics.ts`.

### Accessibility & SEO
- A11y tested in light and dark themes via axe.
- `app/sitemap.ts` and JSON-LD are included; consider adding a dedicated OG image.

### Maintenance notes
- Keep `tailwind.config.ts` content globs aligned with `app/` and `components/`.
- When generating new shadcn components, ensure `components.json` points to `app/globals.css`.


## CI & GitHub Actions Secrets
