SYSTEM
- No em dashes in visible copy.
- Short sentences. Calm tone.
- Next.js 15 App Router. Netlify friendly. Prefer static export.

Goal
Wire the runtime pack into the GAIA site. Ship Resources reveal with event, demo success with logs, Contact API with optional n8n, JSON-LD helper, TrackVitals, Downloads page, and packs zipping script.

Plan
1) Copy files from packs/runtime into the repo in matching folders.
2) In root layout, mount TrackVitals. On the home head, render JsonLd with data/jsonld-*.json if present.
3) Add devDependency "archiver": "^6.0.1" and scripts "prebuild" and "sitemap".
4) Create packs-src/phase-1 and packs-src/phase-2 from packs/phase-* and commit. On build, zips appear in public/packs.
5) Ensure footer links to /downloads and /terms.
6) Confirm /resources shows a reveal and sends track('playbook_downloaded').
7) Confirm demo pages send track('demo_run', { variant }) and show a run log.

Acceptance
- Build and export succeed.
- /downloads lists Phase 1 zip, Phase 2 zip, and the Playbook.
- /resources reveals the Playbook after submit and sends the event.
- Demos render a success panel and a log.
- Contact posts to N8N_WEBHOOK_URL if set else logs.
- No em dashes in UI.
