Goal
Use Notion as a source for public content. Sync Articles and Cases, then render static pages for the Learning Hub and Proof.

Plan
1) Copy packs/notion into the repo. Set NOTION_TOKEN and the two database IDs.
2) Run scripts/sync-notion.mjs locally to create content/blog/*.md and data/blog-index.json and to update data/cases.json.
3) Render /learning-hub from blog-index.json and markdown files. Keep static export friendly.

Acceptance
- /learning-hub lists articles.
- /proof shows cases from data/cases.json.
