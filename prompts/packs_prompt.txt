Goal
Publish delivery packs as stable zips at /packs and add a Downloads page.

Plan
Copy packs/phase-1 and packs/phase-2 into packs-src/phase-1 and packs-src/phase-2.
Add scripts/make-packs.mjs and set "prebuild" to zip them into public/packs.
Add app/downloads/page.tsx and link it in the footer.

Acceptance
Build outputs public/packs/phase-1.zip and phase-2.zip.
/downloads lists the two zips and the Playbook.
