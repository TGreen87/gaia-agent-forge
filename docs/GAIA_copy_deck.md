### Hero
H1: AI you can trust
Sub: Agentic systems and automations. Executive grade guidance that is clear and fast.
Primary CTA: Start a two week pilot
Secondary CTA: Download the Playbook

### Value pillars
- Accuracy with sources. Retrieval and citations come first.
- Simple paths. We remove steps and keep the parts that matter.
- Safer rollouts. Guardrails and human checks before scale.
- Results you can measure. We track accuracy, time saved, and user satisfaction.

### What we refuse to do
- We will not ship a chatbot that guesses.
- We will not hide limits or inflate numbers.
- We will not run risky rollouts that can break production.
- We will not spam you.

### How we work
1. Discover. We pick one two week win and write a one sentence goal.
2. Prototype. We build a narrow slice with your data and tools.
3. Pilot. We measure accuracy and time saved with a small group.
4. Scale. We keep the parts that work and harden them for daily use.

### Proof snapshot
Title: Proposal drafting with citations
Body: We turned a two hour manual process into a twelve minute draft with sources. The team approved the guardrails. The next week the team shipped three proposals with the same quality.

### CTA band
Title: Ready for a first win
Body: Book a short call or download the Playbook to start on your own.

## Why GAIA
Intro: You want results without noise. We agree. Here is how we work.

Principles
- Clarity over jargon.
- Proof over promises.
- Safety over shortcuts.
- Small wins over large plans.

The agentic difference
A chatbot answers once. An agentic system plans steps, calls tools, retrieves knowledge with citations, checks rules, and logs decisions. That pattern gives repeatable results you can trust.

Figure title: Two patterns compared
Figure caption: The agentic path plans, retrieves with citations, calls tools, checks rules, and logs the run. You can add human checks at any step.

Guarantees
- If we are not the right fit, we will say so.
- If a claim is an estimate, we will mark it that way.
- If a risk is present, we will show the guardrail that controls it.

CTA: Start a two week pilot
